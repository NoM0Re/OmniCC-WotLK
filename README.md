## Quick Start

To open the options window, type `/omnicc` or `/occ` into your chat and hit enter.

## Description

OmniCC is an addon that adds text to items, spell and abilities that are on cooldown to indicate when they will<br/>
be ready to use. In other words: it turns all the standard analogue cooldowns into digital ones.<br/>
<br/>
Anything should work with OmniCC, from the action bars to the inventory, from the standard interface to your favorite add-on.<br/>

## Install
1. [Download the package](https://github.com/NoM0Re/OmniCC-WotLK/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Open the archive, then open folder `OmniCC-WotLK-main`, extract the folder to `Interface\AddOns`.

## Problems
* If you've discovered something that's clearly wrong, or if you get an error, please create a [ticket](https://github.com/NoM0Re/OmniCC-WotLK/issues).
